----------PROJECT OUTLINE----------
Deliverables
    You have to submit one single document (6-8 A4 pages + appendices, such as a manual, etc.) through 
    Moodle’s Turnitin submission.

The report should include:
    1. Title page with full student names & SNs
    2. GitHub repository link & a link to a deployed app
    3. Project Proposal
        a. An introduction to the project subject matter
        b. The goals of the project
        c. The strategy that will be employed to meet the stated project goals
        d. The key characteristics of your project in terms of functionality
        e. A list of the project deliverables that will be submitted on project completion 
    4. Overview of the technologies used in your app
    5. Overview of the architecture of your app (including diagrams)
    6. Manual in the appendices (not the main body of your 6-8 page report)
    
The GitHub repository should include:
    1. All code built from day 0 that is traceable (separate account for each member should be used)
    2. Code that came from any Internet sources should be referenced in comments (code that wasn’t 
    referenced properly will not be marked and will be reported for plagiarism)
    3. All code submitted to GitHub after the deadline will not be marked
    
The deployed app repository should:
    1. Be fully working
    2. Should be identical to the app last committed to GitHub at the time of the final submission



The project idea is for a wordsearch that constantly evolves at set intervals 
by shifting the columns of letters across, removing a column on one side
and inserting a new one one the opposite side.

    *Database
        >Dictionary of words stored in an XML file
        >Track longest word found
        >Track total count of all words found
        >Track count for each individual word
        
    *RSS Feed
        >Give global game stats
            >Longest word found
            >Total number of words found
            >Time until next grid update
            >Total number of players(current and overall)
        >Social media updates
            
    *AJAX to dynamically update app
        >Shift columns along
        >Update game stats
        
    *Take user input and allow change (PHP)
        >Visual themes
            >Game colours
            >Font sizes
            >Change Font
            >Disability modes
            
    *Enrich visual effects
        >Juicy JQuery
        >Jaysus that's some Javascript
        >Sexy Stylesheets
        
    *Make responsive for mobile use
        >Bootstrap


***Ongoing Brainstorm***







***Possible future ideas***

    >Background music
        >Sound file stored in database?
                    or
        >Link to spotify soundcloud playlist?
                    or
        >Files stored locally on the server
        
    >Allow users to submit word new word    
        >Must be approved before being added to database
        
    >Cough Hint - JQuery
